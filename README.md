# Golang VSS module
Windows API bindings for the `Volume Shadow Copy Service` in Golang for 32 and 64-bit systems. Enables the user to duplicate entire drives during runtime without any file access issues. The API bindings are accompanied by a simple CLI tool that creates and symlinks Shadow Copies of a given drive.
## Build
You can either import the vss API bindings into your project or use the CLI application. The CLI application can be built with the following command:

Cross-compilation is supported for 32 and 64-bit systems. The following commands will build the CLI application for the respective system:
```shell
make build_win32 # for 32-bit systems
make build_win64 # for 64-bit systems
```

Regular build on Windows:
```shell
make build
```

NOTE: When building you need to set the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable to `1` and the `GOOS` environment variable to `windows`. The `GOARCH` environment variable should be set to `386` or `amd64` depending on the system you are building for.
